### General Instructions

- look at tests for an idea of what is expected
- add your tests if needed
- comment out some expects if you need to see where a test is failing ( this would not be an issue if I followed the rule of one expect per test :D )
- I used `(...args)` as arguments for all functions i gave, you can replace them with your own arguments. eg: (...args) => (a, b)
